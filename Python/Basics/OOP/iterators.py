#iterators are objects and they are used to iterate over iterables like list, tuples sets etc.
#Using two methods. Iter(), next()

# mylist = ["my", "name", "is", "azan"]
# myiter = iter(mylist) # iter return one object a a time from iterable.
# # for i in myiter:
# #     print(i)
# print(next(myiter))
# print(next(myiter))
# print(next(myiter))
# print(next(myiter))
