Virtual Environment:
Virtual Environment for each application 
python3 -m venv env    //for creating virtual Environment
virtual directory is an isolated environment in which we have specific python interpreter and other package
that application need.

Method 01 to create python virtual environment for cmd
python3 -m venv venv
cd venv/Scripts/activate


modern way: 
pipenv (dependencies manager for python projects) = npm (js)
pipenv --venv
pipenv shell to activate virtual environment
exit to deactivate

same version of development machine command[pipenv install --ignore-pipfile]
it install dependcies from piplock.

pipenv graph = to show dependencies
pipenv update -- outdated = update
python -m pydoc math = for documentation
